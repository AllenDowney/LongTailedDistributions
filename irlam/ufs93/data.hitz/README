I have some data that you will need to crunch on a little to get into
the format that you want.  I collected this data before designing the
file system that we use in our "NFS file server appliance".

The data I still have came from three systems:
	
	o my dos machine at home
	o a bunch of networked UNIX machines at Digital.
	o a bunch of networked UNIX machines at Xerox.

The results are in "size:count" pairs, with one line for each size
represented in the file system.  For intsance, here's the start of
the dos data:

    0:527
    1:1
    2:11
    3:1
    4:2

So this means there were 527 files of size zero, 1 file with 1 byte,
11 files with 2 bytes, and so on.  The reason I kept the data at this
level of resolution was so that I could experiment with different blocking
factors and amount-of-data-in-inode sizes.  I hope this is useful.
